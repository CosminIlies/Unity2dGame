# Unity2dGame

## About
This is an unfinished RPG game in Unity with procedurally generated rooms, an Inventory system, NPCs dialogue, a save system, skills, equipment and much more. Even if I decided to abandon this project because it was too ambitious for one person, I learned so much and I had a lot of fun working on it.

## Technologies used
